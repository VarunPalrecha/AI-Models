## Introduction

Predictive analysis is a powerful technique that enables us to make informed decisions by forecasting outcomes based on historical data. In this project, we have harnessed the capabilities of two popular machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest. These models can be applied to a wide range of problems, from predicting stock prices and real estate values to estimating customer behavior and medical outcomes.

## Features

- **Dual Model Approach:** We have implemented both Linear Regression and Random Forest models, allowing you to compare and contrast their performance on different prediction tasks.

- **Flexibility:** The models can be easily adapted to various datasets and prediction scenarios, making them versatile tools for predictive analysis.

- **Model Evaluation:** We provide comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization tools to help you assess the models' accuracy, generalization, and potential areas of improvement.

## Models

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's particularly suitable for scenarios where a linear relationship between the variables exists.

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions for more accurate and robust results. It's well-suited for complex datasets with non-linear relationships.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the AI models for predictive analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VarunPalrecha/AI-Models.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd AI-Models
3. Install the required dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:** Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Choose the appropriate model:** Depending on the nature of your data and prediction task, select either the Linear Regression or Random Forest model.

3. **Train the model:** Use the provided scripts to train the selected model on your dataset.

4. **Evaluate the model:** Utilize the evaluation metrics and visualization tools to assess the model's performance and identify potential areas for improvement.

5. **Make predictions:** Once trained, your model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
